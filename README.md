# Fake-Job-Prediction_NLP_Text-Mining_Data-Analytics
GOAL:
In order to address the growing issue of fraudulent job ads on internet platforms, we are developing a fake job detection model, these models are made to instantly recognize and flag questionable or fraudulent job advertisements and prevent job seekers from falling prey to such scams by identifying and filtering out false postings.
DATA ANALYSIS:
Initially, the data has 18 attributes in which the target variable is considered as the fraudulent variable.
The data has 17,880 records in total.
a.	Treating missing values:
	In the first step of data cleaning,  dropped the job_id and the salary range columns as job_id is just the sequential order of numbers and the salary_range column has a greater number of null values.
	Treated all the missing values using “missing” text so that we improve data quality, minimize bias, and enable complete case analysis, all of them give us accurate imputation. These benefits contribute to more reliable and insightful data analysis and modeling outcomes.
Exploratory data analysis:
•	In exploratory data analysis, gained a solid understanding of the data, identify potential issues, and lay the groundwork for subsequent data mining tasks. It serves as a critical foundation for further analysis, model development, and extracting valuable insights from the data.
